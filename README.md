# EjectionSeat
### Mounted Volume Ejector.  
Just like it says on the tin, this app safely ejects mounted volumes.  
These are typically USB drives, but .dmg files and other mountable formats are supported.  
It lives on the menu bar and provides a convenient and useful tool to the MAC OSX user experience.  
The latest release can be found [Here](https://github.com/pilotchute/EjectionSeat/releases/latest)  

EjectionSeat can be installed using homebrew-cask
```
brew install https://github.com/pilotchute/EjectionSeat/raw/master/ejectionseat.rb
```
